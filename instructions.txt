Welcome to Cura
The digital community front door
Instructions:
Chat Initialization:
Start the chat by simply writing a message in the chat window and pressing “ENTER”.
Triaging Process:
As we are developing the triaging function of Cura, start by asking it questions as if you were a person in need of social care. The chatbot will continue the conversation by asking a series of questions to determine which team is best suited to address your needs.
Response Feedback:
After each response the chatbot provides, use the thumbs up/down at the bottom of the response to provide feedback on the quality. This will open a window which will allow you to give further written feedback if you wish to do so.
Ending the Conversation:
At the end of each conversation, Cura will give you the opportunity to provide overall feedback on its performance. Please take the time to fill this out as it will help us improve the quality of the responses.
Have fun! Try using Cura for different scenarios, from complex and urgent needs, to simpler ones. It is important to test Cura’s abilities in different scenario’s in order to improve its performance in a real-life context. Try “breaking” the chatbot!
